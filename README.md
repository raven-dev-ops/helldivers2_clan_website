## Features

*   **Next.js Framework:** Leverages the power of Next.js for server-side rendering, routing, and API routes.
*   **TypeScript:** Provides static typing for improved code quality and maintainability.
*   **Styled Components:** Utilizes styled-components for styling with CSS-in-JS.
*   **NextAuth.js:** Handles user authentication, including social login providers like Discord (configured). NextAuth.js automatically manages the Discord OAuth2 flow, so you don't need to manually construct authorization URLs.

*   **Particle Effects:** Incorporates `tsparticles` for interactive particle effects.
*   **Swiper:** Uses Swiper for creating touch-enabled sliders.

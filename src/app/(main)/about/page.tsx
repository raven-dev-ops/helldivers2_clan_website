          Welcome to the Galactic Phantom Division, formerly known as the Galactic Phantom Taskforce (GPT Fleet).
          We originated as the zero point for the greatest Helldivers in the galaxy, fostering a community
          of elite skill and camaraderie.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are proud to be the home of Kevindanilooo, the world's first Helldiver to achieve
          1 million total career kills â€“ a testament to the dedication found within our ranks.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we've grown, our mission has expanded. The Galactic Phantom Division now aims to be a premier
          community across multiple gaming universes, bringing our ethos of excellence and teamwork to new frontiers.
